        <p class="text- text-center text-black">Intervalle Genève SA incorporated in Geneva in 1984 taken over in 2014.<br></br> and has its subsidiary in
Ghana as Intervalle Genève-Ghana branch. It is located at No. 2B Plot 48, 6th Avenue, North Ridge
Accra – Ghana and was incorporated in March 8, 2019.
With the continuous increase in the demand for rice coupled with a decreasing rice self-sufficiency ratio
in Ghana and other countries in the sub region, Intervalle Ghana sees a significant opportunity to
contribute to boost local rice production and fill the demand gap and improve rice self-sufficiency ratio
in West Africa. To be able to do this effectively and efficiently, the company would need to overcome
existing bottlenecks in the sector and also work closely with the authorities to see to its fruition.</p>
